Recreating an old game with a new twist.

https://mwayikashoko.github.io/smbmedley/

This is an incomplete remake of Nintendo's Super Mario Bros., and Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels. This is not a port/rom/etc., this is all my code written from scratch in JavaScript designed for the HTML5 canvas. This project not promoted Nintendo. Images used were taken from the original Super Mario Bros and are copyrights of Nintendo. I do not claim any of these assets used to make this remake.
